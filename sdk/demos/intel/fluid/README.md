# WebGL2 Compute Shader Demo

This demo illustrates how "shared memory" will optimize 2D particle fluid simulation by using WebGL2 compute shader, to further optimize the simulation for the GPU, a spatial grid is implemented based on the article "Broad-Phase Collision Detection with CUDA" by Scott Le Grand.

Fluid simulation algorithm and some of the code are porting from [DirectX SDK Samples](https://github.com/walbourn/directx-sdk-samples/tree/master/FluidCS11).
