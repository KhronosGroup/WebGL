Q:  How do I indicate that a newly drafted extension proposal should be built
    for the registry?

A:  Put the extension.xml in a subdirectory of `proposals/` named for the
    official extension name. Once that is committed to the repository, the
    Khronos web site will be automatically updated.

Q:  What if I want to see the changes locally?

A:  Run 'make' from this directory.
